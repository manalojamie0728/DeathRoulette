* The girl's name in the beginning is Ikari Suzumoto, pleading a bargain to the supposed supernatural force that is instigating the fateful curse killings.
* Take note of the details of Kugimiya Oizumi's death in the prologue. Later, when Sayo and Inoue exchange information about the past curse killings, you'll realize that the first letter of her name is part of another name: FURUDE RIKA. Why is the A and K switched? It's a subtle bit of foreshadowing later in the endgame.
* On the subject of anagrams, Suzumoto's surname is part of one: BERNKASTEL. Again, the inscriptions on her hands are clues and lead-ins to the key riddle to be revealed at the endgame.
* The poker thing plays a large part in connecting "The Hunter's Mansion" and "Death Roulette." While it might be irrelevant now, a few games with Sayo can reveal how the culprit is making his moves, much like Erika in the former. That's right, "his."
* Furthermore, the reveal of Sayo's secret hobby foreshadows what will become of her later on: a Designated Villain, a gambit made to catch the real culprit.
* Note that Akira is the first protagonist who has First Person POV. However, he is not one of the central protagonists of the chapter. This can happen to other protagonists as well, having a short spotlight.
* "The countdown is to commence soon." Either the meet-up or the incoming first tragedy, it refers to both.
* Take note of this order, starting from Ichirou: Ichirou, Kyou, Hiroshi, Miyu, Sayo, Inoue, Hikaru, Sumiko, Akira, and Yoshiro.
* It helps to know that the UNO game shows the order in which the protagonists will be killed based on the last numbered card they placed. Subverted by Miyu, who drops a 0.
