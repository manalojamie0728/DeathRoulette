- An interesting twist: nobody dies in this chapter (even though Miyu and Sumiko are pretty much the only ones alive)! Of course, Miyu gets "killed" in the next chapter's prologue. Unless, of course, you count the reveal that Hikaru is dead all along.

* Remember "Star Light, Star Bright" at the end of the phone call in the June Chapter? That plays a VITAL clue here.
