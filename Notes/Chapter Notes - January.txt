* Nursery Rhyme Lyrics - Old Mother Hubbard
	Old Mother Hubbard
	Went to the cupboard
	To get the poor dog a bone,
	But when she got there
	The cupboard was bare
	And so the poor dog had none...

* This chapter's murder is inspired by Richard Ramirez.
* There are TWO nursery rhymes in this chapter: one for Ikari Suzumoto (Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary) and another for Sayo (Old Mother Hubbard).
* Erika Kimura accompanies Sayo at Sacred Heart Village to continue investigating the murder of her former high school friend, Domina Shibuya.
* [CONCEPT] This is when Sayo's second and final trial takes place. Though there are now a few new roadblocks for her defense counsel to overcome due to a lack of witnesses, she ultimately wins the case as Erika and Emmerich had already gotten rid of the corrupt judge at the end of her previous trial.
