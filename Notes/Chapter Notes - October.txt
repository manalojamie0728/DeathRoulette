* Nursery Rhyme Lyrics - Jack and Jill
	Jack and Jill
	Went up a hill
	To fetch a pail of water...
	Jack fell down
	And broke his crown
	And Jill came tumbling after...

* Red Herrings
- Sayo is missing sometime during Act III. Because Hikaru is part of the technicals team and someone is always by her side (Miyu, Sumiko, Aria), her death is impossible. Therefore, Sayo -- as the other focus character -- is logically assumed to die. Except... she comes back stronger than ever. The one who bites the dust instead is Inoue.
- Erika is L.C. and Miyu will die next just because she sang the rhyme (although it IS the chapter's rhyme, Inoue is the only other person who had heard it moments before she is killed). This is what you'll normally think of after hearing the former sing "Jack and Jill." Except... this is heroic Erika, not the insane predator we've first seen in The Hunter's Mansion. Plus, she even advises Miyu on how to pursue the truth properly.

* Foreshadowing
- Miyu knowing some critical information that the others don't (except Erika and possibly, Emmerich) is a clear sign that he is L.C. The nursery rhyme, which he hallucinated, is the biggest indicator of this.
- Erika's conversation with Miyu at the catwalk might count if you read this first before The Hunter's Mansion. By the way, Miyu answering Erika's questions towards the end IS Bernon's promise (contrary to Bernon's promise to avenge Light whatever the cost).

* This chapter's murder is inspired by John Wayne Gacy, the Killer Clown.
* Theater Night - The following sections are assigned the ff. stories (based on Shakespeare's Macbeth):
	1. IV-B - Macbeth Act I
	2. IV-C - Macbeth Act II
	3. IV-D - Macbeth Act III
	4. IV-E - Macbeth Act IV
	5. IV-A - Macbeth Act V
* This marks Erika Kimura's entry into Death Roulette as a guest character.
* [CONCEPT] As one of the main subplots, Sayo decides to resign from her position prior to Theater Night, given that four students have died already during her term. This divides not only her friends and batchmates but the whole STUDENT BODY. It's already worse once you realize she is the prime suspect for the Curse Killings.
* [CONCEPT] Running in parallel with the play is Sayo's first trial. Coincidentally, the plot of the play runs parallel with the actual trial, except the tropes of the actual trial and the play's trial are inversions of each other. The play's plot is a parody on Ace Attorney trials, while Sayo's trial is grounded and more realistic.
* [CONCEPT] There are three villains for this arc: Let Carnegie, Inoue Shinozaki (more of an anti-villain), and the corrupt judge presiding over Sayo's case. Let Carnegie obviously continues to the rest of the story. Inoue gets her redeeming moment near the end of the arc. The third is only stopped because of Erika and Emmerich's interventions, saving Sayo via mistrial (she was handed a "Guilty" verdict).
* [CONCEPT] When Sayo returns at the "climax" of Act V and is revealed to be alive, her eyes become clearer (i.e. whiter, compared to the grayish color before this). This is to signal Sayo's character reinvigoration and "purging of inner demons," as Ikuko describes it. This also establishes her total innocence for any of the crimes. It can also signal the end of the story's first half.
