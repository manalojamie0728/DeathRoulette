* Central Arc Focus: Theater Night
* Primary Location: Kutsutochi Theater

* Major Plot Twist: The two focus characters survive the chapter; Inoue caused the conflict between Sayo and Ichirou's group.

* This chapter's murder is inspired by John Wayne Gacy, the Killer Clown.
* Theater Night - The following sections are assigned the ff. stories (based on Shakespeare's Macbeth):
	1. IV-B - Macbeth Act I
	2. IV-C - Macbeth Act II
	3. IV-D - Macbeth Act III
	4. IV-E - Macbeth Act IV
	5. IV-A - Macbeth Act V
* This marks Erika Kimura's entry into Death Roulette as a guest character.
* [CONCEPT] As one of the main subplots, Sayo decides to resign from her position prior to Theater Night, given that four students have died already during her term. This divides not only her friends and batchmates but the whole STUDENT BODY. It's already worse once you realize she is the prime suspect for the Curse Killings.
* [CONCEPT] Running in parallel with the play is Sayo's first trial. Coincidentally, the plot of the play runs parallel with the actual trial, except the tropes of the actual trial and the play's trial are inversions of each other. The play's plot is a parody on Ace Attorney trials, while Sayo's trial is grounded and more realistic.
* [CONCEPT] There are three villains for this arc: Let Carnegie, Inoue Shinozaki (more of an anti-villain), and the corrupt judge presiding over Sayo's case. Let Carnegie obviously continues to the rest of the story. Inoue gets her redeeming moment near the end of the arc. The third is only stopped because of Erika and Emmerich's interventions, saving Sayo via mistrial (she was handed a "Guilty" verdict).
