- The chapter attempts to justify the presence of the supporting characters (Ikuko, Sanae, Ayumi, Odome, and Aria) by setting them up as replacements to the previous murdered protagonists. Miyu sticks with his original lineup until the end, though.
- The ending presents a subversion in the usual format of the chapters - having Hikaru survive the ordeal. However, the one we see is just someone who looks like her, even having her memories transferred after a brain transplant.

* This chapter's murder is inspired by Jeffrey Dahmer, the Milwaukee Cannibal.
* The nursery rhyme hints another murder, without the knowledge of three survivors. That is, Hikaru as the victim and Miyu as the culprit.
