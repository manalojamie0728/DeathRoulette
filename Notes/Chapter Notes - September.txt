* Nursery Rhyme Lyrics - Humpty Dumpty

	Humpty Dumpty had a great fall,
	Four-score Men and Four-score more,
	Could not make Humpty Dumpty where he was before...

* Foreshadowing
- Early on, Yoshiro gets fallen upon by a shedding palm tree leaf. While the moment is definitely played for laughs, what happens later on when a marble figurine smashes his head is definitely not a laughing matter.

* This chapter's murder is inspired by Charles Edmund Cullen, the Killer Nurse.
