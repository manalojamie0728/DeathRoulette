* Nursery Rhyme Lyrics - Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star
	Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
	How I wonder what you are!
	Up above the world so high,
	Like a diamond in the sky.

	When this blazing sun is gone,
	When there nothing shines upon;
	Then you show your little light,
	Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

	Then the traveller in the dark,
	Thanks you for your little spark;
	He could not see which way to go,
	If you did not twinkle so.

	In the deep blue sky you keep,
	And often through my curtains peep,
	For you never close your eye,
	Till the sun is in the sky.

	As your bright and little spark,
	Lights the traveller in the dark.
	Though I know not what you are,
	Twinkle, Twinkle little star...

* This chapter's murders are inspired by Dr. Harold Shipman (a.k.a. Dr. Death) and the Zodiac Killer. This applies for both Miyu and Sumiko, respectively.
